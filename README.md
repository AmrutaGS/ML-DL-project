# Classifiers and Visualization Techniques for Data Augmentation

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various classifiers and data augmentation visualization techniques. It serves as a reference for building models and understanding how data augmentation impacts image datasets.

## Repository Contents

1. **Binary Classifier**
   - Code for binary classification tasks.

2. **Multi-Label Classifier**
   - Code for handling multi-label classification problems.

3. **Unit Architecture**
   - Core unit architecture implementation for flexible model building.

4. **Visualization Notebook**
   - A notebook dedicated to visualizing data augmentation techniques by applying transformations to a randomly selected image. This helps demonstrate how various augmentation methods produce different versions of the image.

### Usage
- Navigate to the respective directories for each classifier or the visualization notebook.
- Run the scripts or notebooks to explore the implementations.

## Visualization Notebook Details
The visualization notebook applies augmentation techniques, such as rotations, flips, and color adjustments, to a randomly chosen image. This provides insight into:
- The diversity created by augmentation.
- Practical examples of how to use augmentation in preprocessing pipelines.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - TensorFlow
  - PyTorch
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Opencv
